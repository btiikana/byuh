Compile-time bugs are
BETTER THAN
Run-time bugs!

Medicating Run-time bugs is done through declaring/flagging a keyword "abstract" in a class signature.
It forces unintended instantiation to be displayed as compile bug so that we can correct it right away
in our main class.
Abstract makes a compiler work for you.
