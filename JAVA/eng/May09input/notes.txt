SCOPE
    -The part of your program where a fiven variable has mean.
    -In java, a variable's scope is the block {} it was declared in.
    -You cannot use VAR with FIELDS

UNDEERSTANDING VARIABLES AND THEIR POSITIONS.
    For example:
        public class Variables {

            int x = 20;

            public void method (String[] args) {
                int x = 5; --------------> This is a declaration of a new variable.
                x = 5; ------------------> When you don't declare the type you are just updating the FIELDS Variable.
                System.out.println(x) ---> This will print FIELDS Variable.
            }

            int x = 6; ------------------> This isn't practical as it has no value because it is read at the very lastly.
        }

LEARNING ABOUT A CONSTRUCTOR
    -It is similar to a method, except:
    -Its name is ALWAYS the same name as the class.
    -It has no "return type" (not even "void")
    -When you call it you have to include "new".

    For example:
        Public Variable() {
            // Empty
        }
