HOOK

- Hooks are optional methods in a base class that let subclasses
“hook into” the process without changing the core logic.
- Default behavior: usually does nothing
- Override only if needed
- Used inside a fixed algorithm (like a template method)
- Goal: Let subclasses customize parts of the process without rewriting everything
- “Use a hook when you want to offer flexibility without forcing it.
