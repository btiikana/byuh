ðŸ”¹ What is an Abstract Class?
A class that cannot be instantiated (you canâ€™t do new)

Used as a base class to be extended by subclasses

Can have:

Abstract methods (no body)

Regular methods (with body)

Fields/variables

Constructors

ðŸ”¹ When to Use Abstract Classes?
When you want to:

Share common code (fields or methods)

Force subclasses to implement specific methods

Define a template or base structure for all child classes

Declaring an Abstract Class
java
Copy
Edit
public abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void makeSound();  // must be implemented in child class

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Zzz...");
    }
}
Use abstract keyword in class and method

Can contain both abstract and regular methods

ðŸ”¹ What is an Abstract Method?
A method without a body (just a signature)

Must be declared with the abstract keyword

Only allowed inside abstract classes

Must be overridden in the first non-abstract subclass

java
Copy
Edit
public abstract void move();  // no body here!
