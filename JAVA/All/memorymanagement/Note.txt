Polymorphism only works downstream not upstream, meaning you can't
change the main object with the subobject. For example:

Animal cat = new Cat();
Cat lion = new Lion();
Lion lione = new Cat() --> you cannot do this!

Memory leaks are not a problem in java as JVM has it's own garbage collector.
This garbage collector deletes any unused objects in the program and allocates the
space back to the system for other programs to use.
