instanceof - Java Quick Insight

Use instanceof to check if an object is a certain type before casting.
It prevents ClassCastException and lets you safely apply class-specific logic.

Syntax:
object instanceof ClassName

Think of it like:
“Is this object really a ClassName at runtime?”

Always returns false if the object is null.
